# CS320

Within this simple project, I showcase my ability to test software. The testing software that was used was the JUnit. Using the the built in asserTrue methods, I test for functionality in the project.


I began designing my unit tests by reviewing the requirements that were requested. To ensure that the requirements were met, I used them as a framework for my tests. The Task tests that I created would be an example of how I used the requirements in my testing. One of the requirements was for there to be a task description that had to be a String data type that could not be longer than 50 characters and could not be null. In my tests, I checked this requirement by creating instances of the task object with Strings that were less than 50 characters, more than 50 characters, and null.

The software testing techniques that I used were static testing, statement testing, and function testing. Static testing is the process of reviewing the code that has been written without executing it. This typically involves a review process where members and non-members of the development team review the piece of code. Statement testing is the process of testing the different lines of code for their ability to meet requirements. If a requirement asks for a string no longer than 50 characters, a test can check how the code reacts to a string that is longer than 50 characters. Function testing involves testing the various methods and functions of the software. A mutator method that updates a field would need to be tested to ensure that it still meets the requirements laid out. 

# Questions from the couse

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring my code, program, or software is functional will involve testing the software based on the determined requirements. It will also require that I test early and test often to maintain functionality. Code should be designed with security in mind. Avoiding errors, handling data validation, and testing are all ways to create secure software. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Gathering requirements from users is one of the best ways to find out what users want in a system. Meeting with customers and end-users is a method to obtain requirements. After gathering the requirements, it is important to follow up with any questions or concerns that are associated with the requirements. 

How do I approach designing software?

What designing software, I like to review the requirements first. I begin with planning out the different objects and information that I will need. I use UML diagrams to get a layout of the project and to see any relationships with the object. I then review my diagrams and make updates and edit them. Finally, I begin to write my software.
