How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Ensuring my code, program, or software is functional will involve testing the software based on the determined requirements. It will also require that I test early and test often to maintain functionality. Code should be designed with security in mind. Avoiding errors, handling data validation, and testing are all ways to create secure software. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Gathering requirements from users is one of the best ways to find out what users want in a system. Meeting with customers and end-users is a method to obtain requirements. After gathering the requirements, it is important to follow up with any questions or concerns that are associated with the requirements. 

How do I approach designing software?

What designing software, I like to review the requirements first. I begin with planning out the different objects and information that I will need. I use UML diagrams to get a layout of the project and to see any relationships with the object. I then review my diagrams and make updates and edit them. Finally, I begin to write my software.
